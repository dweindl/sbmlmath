# sbmlmath â€” a Python library for handling SBML MathML

This is a Python library for interconverting [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/)
expressions and [SBML](https://sbml.org/)-MathML.
SBML uses a subset of [MathML](https://www.w3.org/Math/) that this library
aims to support. This is not (intended to be) a general MathML parser.

Main functionality:

* sympy -> SBML MathML
* SBML MathML -> sympy
  * in particular for cases where `sympy.sympify(libsbml.formulaToL3String(...))`
    won't do the job
    (mind the differences operator precedence between
    sympy/[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence)
    and [libsbml L3 formulas](https://synonym.caltech.edu/software/libsbml/5.18.0/docs/formatted/python-api/libsbml-math.html#math-l3)!)
  * retaining unit annotations and other `<ci>` attributes

**NOTE: This is under development and the API is to be considered unstable**

Python support policy: sbmlmath follows [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html).

## Usage

```python
from sbmlmath import SBMLMathMLPrinter, SBMLMathMLParser
import sympy as sp

sympy_expr = sp.sympify("A ** B + exp(C) * D")
mathml = SBMLMathMLPrinter().doprint(sympy_expr)
print(mathml)

cycled_sympy = SBMLMathMLParser().parse_str(mathml)
print(cycled_sympy)
assert sympy_expr == cycled_sympy
```
