# sbmlmath - a Python library for handling SBML MathML

This is Python library for interconverting [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/)
expressions and [SBML](https://sbml.org/) MathML.
SBML uses a subset of [MathML](https://www.w3.org/Math/) that this library
tries to support. This is not (intended to be) a general MathML parser.

Main functionality:

* sympy -> SBML MathML
* SBML MathML -> sympy
  * in particular for cases where `sympy.sympify(libsbml.formulaToL3String(...))`
    won't do the job
  * retaining unit annotations and other `<ci>` attributes

**NOTE: This is under development and the API is to be considered unstable**

## Usage

```python
from sbmlmath import SBMLMathMLPrinter, SBMLMathMLParser
import sympy as sp

sympy_expr = sp.sympify("A ** B + exp(C) * D")
mathml = SBMLMathMLPrinter().doprint(sympy_expr)
print(mathml)

cycled_sympy = SBMLMathMLParser().parse_str(mathml)
print(cycled_sympy)
assert sympy_expr == cycled_sympy
```
